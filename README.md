# JS Fun

Step 1. Make usre you have git installed, if you're on OSX you probably all set. Go to the terminal app, and at the command prompt type.

```
git 
```

If it's installed you'll see the git usage info.


Step 2. Still in the terminal move to a directory where you would want this project to live.  Then type

```
git clone https://github.com/ufmemo/js-fun.git
```

Step 3. In the terminal, move into that directory and open VS Code (if you don't have it install it).

Step 4. Install Live Server Extension (Code > Preferences > Type Live Server > Install)

Step 5. Right click on the index.html page, then click "Open with Live Server".  This should open your default browser and allow you to see changes in the browser in realtime w/o needing to refresh.
